Your FastAPI backend is now running on EC2 (IP: 98.83.145.159, Port: 8000), allowing file uploads via POST /upload/. The React frontend integrates with this API by sending a multipart/form-data request containing the file. In React, create an UploadFile.js component that captures file input and sends it to the FastAPI endpoint using fetch(). Ensure your AWS Security Group allows port 8000 and that FastAPI is running in the background (tmux, screen, or systemd). Test uploads using curl or the React UI, and verify saved files in /home/ubuntu/uploads/. Next steps include file encryption, authentication, and a file listing API for better security and usability
